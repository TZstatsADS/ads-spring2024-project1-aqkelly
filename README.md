Term: Spring 2024

+ Projec title: Will your source of happiness change after 50?
+ This project is conducted by Jiaqi Lu

+ Project summary: People change the way of thinking and behaving as they grow, but what about the source of happiness? Will the things that interest you in your 20s also interest you after your 50s? This report will use a dataset with 100,000 happy moments to answer this question.
